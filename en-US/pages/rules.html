                            <p><number>1.</number>Players must respect other players and staff. Any form of insult, discrimination, prejudice to the image of others is punished. Being courteous and polite is essential.</p>

                            <p><number>2.</number>The staff is present in the game in order to maintain order and peace on the server, therefore, any form of flood, disrespect or other negative behavior towards a staff member may be punished.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p><number>3.</number>Spamming, preventing the correct readability of the chat is prohibited. Avoid unnecessary messages and give maximum priority to private messages.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><number>4.</number>The use of SMS language in game or on the Discord is not recommended. Express yourself in as correct a language as possible.</p>

                            <p><number>5.</number>Advertising for any server, religion, product, service, organization or political movement is prohibited. Exceptions may be granted upon request to the Staff.</p>

                                <number>6.</number>Anyone posting ingame or Discord messages that incite hatred of the server or bring bad mood will be punished. Aycraft is an entertainment space, any conflicts that may exist between a player and the
                                Aycraft Staff must be resolved privately.

                                <number>7.</number>Aycraft is not a dating site. DO NOT give personal information to another player (email, name, address, phone number...). Beware of disgraceful people. Never agree to meet someone you don't know in the
                                real world.

                                <number>8.</number>Each player is identified by his Minecraft account and/or his Discord account. Thus, if someone other than you breaches these rules through your Minecraft or Discord account, the entire account will be
                                sanctioned even if you can prove that it was not you (as a natural person) who was using the account at the time. It is therefore strongly discouraged to lend your account/disclose your password. Nevertheless, the staff
                                reserves the right to sanction accounts sharing the same physical owner if the team deems it necessary.

                                contestable.
